A client site to showcase a local family-run pizza business, includes a sample menu and more information about the restaurant's founders alongside opening hours and contact infomation.

Link to project: https://mariospizzeria.netlify.app/

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Optimizations

If I further refined this project, I would add a page to showcase the reviews the restaurant has received and link to their social media so customers can see up to date images directly from the restaurant. 


## Lessons Learned:

Separation of concerns. Manipulating the images using CSS instead of inside the html documents.
